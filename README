File Browser Applet 0.5.6
******************************
File Browser Applet is an applet for the GNOME Panel. It lets you browse
and open files in your home directory from the gnome panel, without having to
open a file manager. It is _not_ intended as replacement to proper file
managers like nautilus. Sometimes you (like me) just want to open a file and
don't want to have to open a file manager, browse to and open the file, then
close the file manager. This Applet just saves you couple of clicks.

Features
********
	* Browse and open files in your home directory from the panel.
	* Respects Gnome mime type options and includes mime icon in menu.
	* Middle clicking in a directory header will open a terminal in that
	  directory.
	* Middle-clicking on file will open with the configured editor,
	  right-clicking will execute the default action
	* Configuration options: Select directories to show (and label), select
	  icon, show/hide icon, show hidden, select terminal and editor. Uses
	  GConf as back-end.

Installation
************
See the file INSTALL.

To Do
*****
	* Make the menu bar ignore right-click so context menu pops-up, and remove handlebar.
	* Add context menu (open with, delete, etc.) to files and dirs (maybe
	  hook into nautilus context menu if possible).
	* Drag-n-drop out of applet.
	* Drag-n-drop configuration.
	* Add append files to "Recent Documents."
	* Add key-binding to pop-up root menu.
	* More Documentation
	* A better icon.
	* Translation.
	* Generating distribution packages.

Bugs
****
	* Icon sometimes appears blurry (bug #10)
	* Some bugs associated with gnome_vfs (#12 - Can't make a menu that starts
	  at /; Can't open files with # in name).
	* There are probably a few memory leaks here and there too...

Hacking
*******
Contributions are welcome, but it might take a while for them to make it into a
release as I (unfortunately) don't always have a lot of time to devote to this
project (and other lame excuses). Send ideas/code/patches to
bertoldia@gmail.com for now.
