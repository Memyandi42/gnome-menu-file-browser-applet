File Browser Applet 0.6.0
******************************
File Browser Applet is an applet for the GNOME Panel. It lets you browse and
open files in your home directory from the gnome panel, without having to open
a file manager. It is _not_ intended as replacement to proper file managers
like nautilus. Sometimes you (like me) just want to open a file and don't want
to have to open a file manager, browse to and open the file, then close the
file manager. This Applet just saves you couple of clicks.

Features
********
	* Browse and open files in your home directory from the panel.
	* Respects Gnome mime type options and includes mime icon in menu.
	* Middle clicking (or F4) in a directory header will open a terminal in
	  that directory.
	* Middle-clicking (or F4) on file will open with the configured editor,

	  files.

Hacking
*******
Contributions are welcome, but it might take a while for them to make it into a
release as I (unfortunately) don't always have a lot of time to devote to this
project (and other lame excuses). Send ideas/code/patches via the bug tracker
(http://code.google.com/p/gnome-menu-file-browser-applet/issues/list).
