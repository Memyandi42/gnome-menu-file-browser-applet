Version 0.5.3
*************
	* Re-implemented preferences back end to use GConf which means each
	  instance of the applet can show different directories.

Version 0.5.2
*************
	* Added handling of changes in panel (size allocation, background and orientation).

Version 0.5.1
*************
	* Fixed bug #3: Crash on opening folders without access permissions.
	* Added messages for empty directories or failure to open a directory.
	* Slightly improved appearance (removed border).
	* Fixed bug #6: Executable files are now handled more intuitively: if the
	  file is binary and executable it is launched on either left of middle
	  click. If the file is text and executable (i.e. a script), left clicking
	  opens it for editing, middle click runs it.
	* Cleaner display: directory headers now only show current directory name
	  (instead of the whole path). File and directories names also have max length.
	* Added Config options: Can select dirs to show (and label), select icon,
	  show/hide icon, show hidden, select terminal More/better error checking.
	  rc file has to be edited manually for now.
	* Code cleanup/refactoring.

Version 0.3.0
*************
	* Initial release to the public!
