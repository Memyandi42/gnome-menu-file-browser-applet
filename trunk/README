Menu File Browser Applet 0.3.0
******************************
Menu File Browser Applet is an applet for the GNOME Panel. It lets you browse
and open files in your home directory from the gnome panel, without having to
open a file manager. It is _not_ intended as replacement to proper file
managers like nautilus. Sometimes you (like me) just want to open a file and
don't want to have to open a file manager, browse to and open the file, then
close the file manager. This Applet just saves you couple of clicks.

Features
********
	* Browse and open files in your home directory from the panel
	* Respects Gnome mime type options and includes mime icon in menu
	* Middle clicking in a directory header will open a terminal in that directory
	* More to come. Maybe

Installation
************
See the file INSTALL.

To Do
*****
	* Drag-n-drop out of mfba
	* add context menu (open with, delete, etc.) to files and dirs (possibly hook into nautilus context
	  menu if possible)
	* Some configuration options might be nice
	* Documentation
	* A better icon
	* Translation (I haven't a clue how to do this)
	* Generating distribution packages
	* Code cleanup
	* Suggestions anyone?
	* Please keep in mind that I'd actually like to keep the number of
	  features/options to a bare (and truly useful) minimum

Bugs
****
	* There are none ;-)
	* There are probably a few memory leaks here and there
Send bugs to bertoldia@gmail.com for now.

Hacking
*******
Contributions are welcome, but it might take a while for them to make it into a
release as I (unfortunately) don't always have a lot of time to devote to this
project (and other lame excuses). Send ideas/code to bertoldia@gmail.com for
now.
