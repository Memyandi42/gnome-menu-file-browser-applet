lib-menu-browser???

I want to query "the community" to see if anyone would be interested in having the menu-based file browser functionality of this applet exported as a lib that could (very) easily be used in other apps.

This could be accomplished with very little work on my part, and would be hella-easy to use in another application.

The interface would be something like:

{{{
GtkWidget *my_menu = gtk_menu_new();

gtk_menu_shell_append (GTK_MENU_SHELL (my_menu),
                       menu_browser_new (const gchar *path,
                                         const gchar *label,
                                         BrowserPrefs *prefs));
/* prefs can be NULL for default */
}}}

Currently prefs includes the terminal to launch on middle-click on a folder, the editor to use on middle click on a file and whether or not to show hidden files/folders. Maybe path and label could be rolled into prefs. Additionally, other parameters could be added to further change the widget's behaviour such as what functions to call on left/right/middle clicks and such.

Please post back with level of interest, related ideas and possible uses.
